### Extensible contest system
Contests feature an optional rating system, and can be configured to run in any timeframe. Users are also able to participate virtually after the contest ends. ICPC, IOI, AtCoder, and ECOO contest formats are supported out-of-the-box, and new formats can be added with custom code.

Contests may be limited to particular organizations, or require access codes to join. Hidden scoreboards are supported. The contest system integrates with [Stanford MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) to provide plagiarism checking. 
Editorial support is built-in, and editorials are automatically published once a contest ends.


### Home page blog and activity stream

Announcements from administrators, ongoing contests, recent comments and new problems are easily accessible from the home page.

### Internationalized interface
Use the site in whatever language you're most comfortable in &mdash; currently fully supporting English, Simplified Chinese, and Romanian. Problem authors can provide statements in multiple languages, and DMOJ will display the most relevant one to a reader.
